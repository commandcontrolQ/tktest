# tktest
Test program for the Tkinter (and Pillow) module.

# Installing the 'pillow' module
To install the 'pillow' module, you can enter the following commands:
- `pip install pillow` if pip is located in PATH
- `python -m pip install pillow` if pip is not located in PATH
If you are running Linux, you may have to append `--break-system-packages` to install pillow, however this is not recommended, as it is better that you install pillow through your distribution's package manager.

For example, the Debian distro provides the module under the package 'python-pil'.

# Usage
Regardless of whether you use the precompiled executables or the Python script, the first thing to launch will be a main window.

This window will contain buttons to the types of windows available in tktest.
