# tktest

# Required modules
The following modules are required to start the program:

- Tkinter (Bundled by default in Windows installations, Linux users must manually install the `python3.x-tk` package).
- PIL (Linux users must install both `python3-pil` and `python3-pil.imagetk`, Windows users can just run `pip install pillow`)

# Usage
Whether you use the precompiled executables or the Python script, the first thing to launch will be a main window.

This window will contain buttons for the types of windows available in tktest.
